Replace your sneakers often. At least after every 250 - 500 miles of walking/running.
Stair climbing is a low-impact alternative to running.
Choose exercises that you enjoy doing. You'll be more inclined to stick with a fitness regimen when it includes things you like to do.
Change your fitness routine every 4-6 weeks to prevent a workout plateau.
Strive to include total body workouts. These include: cardiovascular exercises, strength training (both upper and lower body), core training and stretching/flexibility.
Measure your exercise intensity. There are several methods: heart rate, rating of perceived exertion, talk test.
Whenever possible, take the stairs instead of an elevator.
Stretching and flexiblity are very important aspects of good physical fitness, so don't overlook them. Ideally, you should stretch before each workout (both cardio and resistance exercises) and after each workout. If you can't do both, then make the after stretching a priority.
When stretching before a workout, it's best to stretch after you've gotten warmed-up for about 5 minutes (your muscles will be looser).
When working out on cardio equipment (e.g. elliptical trainers), don't lean heavily on the handrails. This will reduce the amount of calories you burn.
